### Welcome

I'm Joseph and this is my Github profile.

I do some [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/team/138100), I love doing [one liners in python](https://github.com/jlsajfj/one-lyne), and I'm learning to make a [web app](https://github.com/jlsajfj/ellie-and-edward).

<!--[Check out my portfolio!](https://github.com/jlsajfj/Portfolio)-->

I hope you enjoy your stay!
